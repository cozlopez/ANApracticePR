    "- The timing, power and duration of two burns: an initial burn to leave Earth orbit, and a final burn to enter lunar orbit.\n",
    "- Each burn is to have a maximum acceleration of 0.1g and a maximum duration of 1.5 hours - at least one complete orbit of Earth should be performed before the first burn.\n",
    "- Each burn can only be in the direction of travel, but may be positive or negative.\n",
    "- The final lunar orbit must be approximately circular, stable, and close to the moon.  Specifically: for a period of 1 week after the final time the distance to the (center of the) moon should never be greater than $\\frac{1}{20}x_{moon}$, and the orbital eccentricity $e < 0.1$.\n",
